# Current/Voltage Plotter

This is a microcontroller project to measure and plot the current/voltage curve for a two-terminal device.
It is a combination of an Arduino-based circuit to apply different voltages to a device
and measure the current that flows through it. The data is captured over the serial monitor
and fed through a Python script that plots the graph. Here is an example using a 3V Zener diode:
